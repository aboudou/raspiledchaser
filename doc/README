How to use RasPiLEDChaser
********************

You'll first have to build the LED chaser, and plug it to the Raspberry Pi
  (check https://goddess-gate.com/dc2/index.php/pages/raspiledmeter.en for more 
  information).

When you're done, just launch RasPiLEDChaser with "./raspiledchaser.sh start" as
  root user and admire the LED chaser working :-) When you want / need to stop
  it, just execute "./raspiledchaser.sh stop" as root user.
