RasPiLEDChaser for Raspberry Pi

********************
Requirements
********************

 - First of all : a Raspberry Pi
 - LED and resistors to build the LED chaser
   Assembly instructions are available at the following URL
   https://goddess-gate.com/dc2/index.php/pages/raspiledmeter.en
   (This is for a different project, but the assembly is the same)
 - Python (with Debian / Raspbian : packages "python" and "python-dev")
 - RPi.GPIO library (0.3.1a or newer) from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO

To help you with the assembly, you may refer to the following files :
 - raspiledchaser.sch : the circuit diagram to open with EAGLE
   (http://www.cadsoft.de/freeware.htm)
 - You may need to download and install Raspberry Part for Fritzing
   https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/blob/master/AdaFruit.fzbz
 - raspiledchaser.fzz : the assembly mockup to open with Fritzing
   (http://fritzing.org/)

How to use RasPiLEDChaser
********************

You'll first have to build the LED chaser, and plug it to the Raspberry Pi
  (check https://goddess-gate.com/dc2/index.php/pages/raspiledmeter.en for more 
  information).

When you're done, just launch RasPiLEDChaser with "./raspiledchaser.sh start" as
  root user and admire the LED chaser working :-) When you want / need to stop
  it, just execute "./raspiledchaser.sh stop" as root user.
